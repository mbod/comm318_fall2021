## COMM318: _Stories from data_: Introduction to programming for data journalism

**Fall 2021: M/W 3:30-5:00pm (via synchronous Zoom)**  

**Professor**: Dr. Matt O'Donnell (he/him/his)

**Email**: mbod@asc.upenn.edu

**Class sessions**: Will be on Zoom. A link for each class is available in the Zoom tab in the course Canvas. You will be expected to be present in each class. Please submit a Course Absence Report (CAR) before class if you will be unable to attend.


**Office hours**: Virtual online meetings through Zoom

* Initially i have scheduled:

  1. Tuesday 2-3pm EST
	2. Fridays 2-3pm EST as an _open coding help session_
	3. You should always feel able to email me to set up a meeting if you cannot make one of these times.

**NOTE:** There is no TA in this course. But we are fortunate to have:
* **Information technology and programming  assistant**: Etienne Jacquot

* **Email**: etienne.jacquot@asc.upenn.edu (he/him/their)

   Etienne will often be in class sessions and will be able to help out with technical issues related to the class JupyterHub setup. He is also an experienced data engineer and Python programmer. Within limits he may be able to assist with code and data analysis questions. BUT remember _he is not a TA_.


## Course Description, Goals and Objectives

Today masses of data are available everywhere, capturing information on just about everything and anything. Related but distinct data streams about newsworthy events and issues -- including activity from social media and open data sources (eg: The Open Government Initiative) -- have given rise to a new source for and style of reporting sometimes called Data Journalism. Increasingly, news sites and information portals present visually engaging, dynamic, and interactive stories linked to the underlying data (e.g. The Guardian DataBlog, LA Times Data Desk). The Covid-19 pandemic has amplified this trend.

This course offers an introduction to Python programming for data analysis and visualization. Students will learn how to collect, analyze, and present various forms of data. Second, because numbers and their visualizations do not speak for themselves but require context, interpretation, and narrative, students will practice making effective stories from data and presenting them in blogs, articles and other formats.

No prior programming experience is required. Through this course students will gain skills writing Python programs to handle large amounts of data and become familiar with some of the key techniques used by data scientists, which is currently one of the most in-demand jobs.

* This course will provide an introduction to Python programming for collecting, cleaning, describing and analyzing a range
of publicly available datasets, including demographic (e.g., age, race, education levels by geographic area),
medical (e.g. Covid infection and vacination, ER intakes for certain conditions like flu, measles, etc),
financial (e.g., spending on infrastructure, education, other initatives, income distribution, etc.), event (e.g., crime data, road accidents) and
transportation (e.g., usage statistics for public transportation and private schemes, e.g. bike shares).

* Each week one session will be in lecture form and provide background for the theory and techniques and the second will be a lab session
in which students will work through programming exercises using Jupyter notebooks (a web-based programming environment well suited for data science and class-based assignments). Often there will be a video lecture to watch before the session.

* By completing this course students will:
	* gain an understanding of how data can be used to support the reporting and making of news and other types of storytelling
	* practice skills of making stories by collecting, transforming, visualizing and analyzing publicly available data

	* explore the range of various kinds of data now available through initiatives such as Open Government Data initiative (data.gov) and a range of other available and curated data archives

	* be exposed to a range of techniques from data journalism, data science and information visualization and understand how they can be used to tell news/media stories
	* gain a basic level of programming proficiency in the Python programming language and have completed a number of programming exercises to collect, clean, analyze, visualize and interpret such data

## Resources

* Recommended reading

    * The two books by Ben Jones in The Data Literacy Series:
      1. _Data Literacy Fundamentals: Understanding the Power & Value of Data_
      2. _Learning to See Data: How to Interpret the Visual Language of Charts_
    * Tim Harford, _The Data Detective: Ten Easy Rules to Make Sense of Statistics_. Riverhead Books (February 2, 2021)
    * David Spiegelhalter, _The Art of Statistics: How to Learn from Data_. Basic Books (August 17, 2021)
    * Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic, _Storytelling with data: A visualization guide for business professionals_, Wiley (2015)


* Other readings on data journalism and resources for learning Python programming and data analysis will be made available on the class Canvas site and the course github repository.


## Assessment


1. **Attend weekly lab sessions and complete the assigned readings and exercises (40%)**
  * Wednesday class sessions will usually be programming labs. We will be using Jupyter notebooks to learn Python, which are part of a web-based interactive programming environment. You must have a github account to access the server. If you do not have an account go to https://github.com/join and set one up. Assignments will be completed in this environment and submitted to the instructor. Details of using this system for assignments will be covered in the first lab session.
  * Assignments will usually be due at __11.59 p.m. (EST) on the Friday__ (but this may vary). These assignments are intended to help students practice the programming concepts and structures introduced in lab and build confidence. They should not be difficult or take excessive time but they do build from week to week so it is _very_ important to keep up.


2. **Complete a _group data story project_ that uses the techniques and theory covered in class to carry out a data analysis of a specific research question agreed upon with the instructor (60%)**

 * The groups will be assigned during the first couple of weeks of class. You will work in your group in breakout rooms during lab sessions.

 * More details of the kinds of projects that would be appropriate and manageable will be discussed during the first few weeks of class.

 * The key steps of the project will be scheduled throughout the course allowing for the instructor to help you find a manageable problem, acquire the necessary data and be able to carry out the appropriate computational analysis.

 * We will discuss the expected structure and components of the project. Some elements will be assessed on an individual basis (e.g. in your group you will each be responsible for one of the data sources relevant to your research question and you will carry out the acquisition, inspection, cleaning and exploration steps on that data source) and others will be graded as a group (e.g. the initial and final project presentations and the project blog)

## Note about learning programming

A central goal of this class is to help students begin to develop programming skills that they can use to approach questions of interest using the various open datasets and data sources available. But like learning any new skill, such as a new language, it takes time and can be frustrating at first. This course does not require students to have any programming background. Realistically it is not possible to become a fully proficient programmer in just one semester. However, the lab sessions and assignments are focused on helping you begin this process and to become comfortable with reading, understanding and modifying Python code examples that you can find on the web etc.
